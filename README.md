Who hasn't had problems adding aliases to their linux? Or setting a hostname? Don't complicate things, use **zfAlias**

## About zfAlias
To create a more interesting and dynamic environment for programmers, I thought of creating a tool that injects information into files, for example aliases or hostnames. Going directly to put an alias seems very boring and sometimes we just don't do it and continue doing more extensive tasks, running a light program to add it for you seems easier, doesn't it?
You don't have to use it all the time, but when you need it, it will be there to help you :)

## Installation


```bash
  # Extract the files:
  https://github.com/raineridev/zfAlias.git
  # Enter the folder
  cd zfAlias
  # Run the initializer
  bash ./zfAlias.sh
```
